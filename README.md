**Walmart Sales Analysis**

1. ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmartâ€™s historical sales dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The analysis focuses on identifying factors affecting weekly sales, seasonality, store performance, and prediction of future sales.

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning models**, we aim to provide actionable recommendations that can help improve Walmartâ€™s sales forecasting and decision-making.



2. ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset contains weekly sales information from different Walmart stores and includes:

* **Store** â€“ Store ID
* **Date** â€“ Week of sales
* **Weekly\_Sales** â€“ Sales for the given store on the given week
* **Holiday\_Flag** â€“ Whether the week included a holiday (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
* **Temperature** â€“ Average temperature in the region
* **Fuel\_Price** â€“ Fuel price in the region
* **CPI** â€“ Consumer Price Index
* **Unemployment** â€“ Unemployment rate



3. ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Walmart needs to:

1. Identify **sales trends** across time, stores, and holidays.
2. Understand how **economic factors** (fuel prices, CPI, unemployment) impact sales.
3. Predict **future weekly sales** with higher accuracy to optimize inventory and promotions.



4.âœ… Solution Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ Handled missing values, formatted dates, and normalized features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identified top-performing stores, seasonal effects, and holiday impacts.
3. **Sales Forecasting Models** â€“ Built and compared regression models for predicting weekly sales.
4. **Evaluation** â€“ Compared predicted vs. actual sales to validate model accuracy.
5. **Insights & Recommendations** â€“ Suggested improvements for marketing, inventory, and resource allocation.



5. ðŸ“Š Key Insights

* Holiday weeks show **significant spikes** in sales, requiring better inventory planning.
* Sales have a **seasonal trend**, with peaks during festivals and year-end.
* Economic indicators (fuel price, unemployment, CPI) influence sales but are **less significant** compared to seasonality and holidays.
* Predictive models achieved **high accuracy**, making them reliable for short-term forecasting.



6. ðŸ“Œ Files in Repository

* `Walmart_Sales_EDA.py` â†’ Python script with full data analysis and visualization.
* `Walmart_Sales_Report.docx` â†’ Detailed project report with findings and recommendations.
* `README.md` â†’ Project overview.


7.  ðŸš€ Future Work

* Implement **time-series forecasting models** (ARIMA, LSTM) for long-term prediction.
* Develop an **interactive dashboard** for real-time sales monitoring.
* Add **external factors** (weather, promotions, regional events) for deeper insights.
